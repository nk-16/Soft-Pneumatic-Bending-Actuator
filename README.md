# Soft-Pneumatic-Bending-Actuator
I aimed to optimise the design parameters of a soft pneumatic actuator using finite element methods. Our goal was to achieve maximum bending at specific pressures while minimising stress concentrations. Additionally, I explored alternative designs to enhance efficiency within soft robotics.
