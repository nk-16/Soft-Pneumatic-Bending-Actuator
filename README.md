# Soft-Pneumatic-Bending-Actuator
Working on optimisation of the design parameters of a soft pneumatic actuator using finite element methods. The goal was to achieve maximum bending at specific pressures while minimising stress concentrations. Additionally, I explored alternative designs to enhance efficiency within soft robotics.
